## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* Diagnostics Summit next week, two topics submitted: general Diagnostics and async hooks
  * Both on the 25th (9:30AM diagnostics, 1:00PM  unifying hooks)

### nodejs/diagnostics

* \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
  *  Stephen working on a few things
    * Problem in V8 about thenables, landed in V8 master, cherry pick in master, completely
      fixes the thenables issue.

  * Another PR: trampoline function to avoid back and forth with callbacks (reduces three entries to one, enable us to move async_hooks to JS, no need to coordinate with native code). Consuming data from async hooks only works well on the JS side. Today executionasyncresource is used to communicate between native and JS
    * Promises and some other edge cases where you can’t wrap will remain three entries
  * No changes to the public API
  * Some changes to executionAsyncResource, but most shouldn’t be observable for users
  * Any remaining issues with AsyncResources? Not really, biggest issue was thenables, which needed to be fixed on V8
* Discuss usage and support of eBPF [#386](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/386)
  * Should we remove it from the agenda? We have an action item to discuss it on the deep dive meeting. Let’s try to add a label to automatically add to the deep dive issue, if it works we can remove the diag-agenda, otherwise we can try again in two weeks.
  * Goal of this issue was to start discussion, current action time is to talk on deep dive. There’s a TSC strategic initiative to rework tracing, we shouldn’t drive it but keep an eye to make sure it’s aligned with UJ.
* Reviving "Zones" like proposals to TC39 [#375](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/375)
  * Presented on TC39 June meeting. Lots of concerns on dynamic context
  * Currently working on an improved design
  * Changes to the proposal:
    * reduce surface, implement AsyncLocal (similar to AsyncLocalStorage)
    * Removed hooks from the proposal entirely
      * On Node.js we can still have async hooks, restricted version of AsyncLocal on the language
  * Do we need to make changes to AsyncLocalStorage?
    * We can make changes to Node.js implementation after we have reached Stage 1 at TC39
  * Plan to share the new design with other champions and delegates before next meeting

* COVID-19 and WG sittings [#370](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/370)
  * All good
  * Should we cancel next weeks meeting due to the summit?
    * This will be the second deep dive we skip
    * Should we have deep dive in two weeks instead of the regular meeting?
    * No objections
* reportVersion semantics are not defined [#349](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/349)
  * mmarchini still have an AI to comment on the issue
  * Gireesh: the report is stable now, the discussion is mostly internal, no issues raised by users, and we should focus on a lightweight format instead of a protocol or schema
  * Let’s keep discussion on the issue
  * Remove from the agenda, re-add if necessary
* Node CPU Profiling Roadmap [#148](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/148)
  * Remove from the agenda until someone has time to work on it.

* Collaborators Survey
  * Some folks raised issues with diagnostics
  * Worth opening an issue to discuss and investigate
