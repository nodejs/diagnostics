Minutes
================================================================================


AsyncWrap
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1:29](https://youtu.be/vxY_OLHF66A?t=89) -
https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/669#issuecomment-147502997

Andreas:

Error handling facilities.  Catching errors in asyncWrap is difficult, as you
lose some context because of having to catch uncaughtException yourself.
Perhaps add "unhandled except for this async event", should be straight-forward.
Sounds like there was some hope of domains handling this, but looking to avoid
that magic.

Patrick: Let's get this in the
[list of Async Wrap issues](https://github.com/nodejs/tracing-wg/issues/29)
issue. (Actually already there: under "**onerror**"
[#669 - async-wrap: no way to catch errors without changing the throw origin](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/669)
)


finalize slide for this WG in the Foundation's “Getting Involved” slides
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4:40](https://youtu.be/vxY_OLHF66A?t=280) -
https://github.com/nodejs/foundation-slides/pull/7/files#r42398718

Patrick:

Node Foundation maintains slides for working groups with brief description:

* https://github.com/nodejs/foundation-slides/blob/master/index.html

Current suggestion for description of this WG is:

> Mission is to provide portable tools and hooks to access high performance
> tracing capabilities in Node.js.

No nays.  Patrick will amend the PR and ask for merge.


AsyncWrap task list issue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[6:12](https://youtu.be/vxY_OLHF66A?t=372) -
https://github.com/nodejs/tracing-wg/issues/29

Andreas: provided a brief rundown on the issues mentioned here.

Trevor:

* from Promises - we will have to contribute support; Trevor thinks there's an
  issue in V8 on this, should be filled in on the issue 29 item placeholder

* native module support - Fedor has mentioned making js stream public, which
  would require AsyncWrap be public, which would solve that problem


trace_event.h tracking issue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[10:50](https://youtu.be/vxY_OLHF66A?t=650) -
https://github.com/nodejs/tracing-wg/issues/30

Stephen:

* no updates on issue

Ali:

* lots of changes have gone into trace events since discussion two months ago
* being actively worked on, get into V8 soon-ish
* Chrome code review link in the header of the issue seems to be recently active;
go to watch the magic happening.

Tracing use cases and interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[14:46](https://youtu.be/vxY_OLHF66A?t=886) -
https://github.com/nodejs/tracing-wg/issues/31

Patrick:

Luca had created this issue, but not on call.  Not much movement here.

Should restructure this to create a task list


Add “Getting involved doc” in foundation slides
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[16:27](https://youtu.be/vxY_OLHF66A?t=987) -
https://github.com/nodejs/tracing-wg/issues/33

Patrick:

cross-issue for the Node Foundation WG slide, already covered


Lttng tracing improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[16:40](https://youtu.be/vxY_OLHF66A?t=1000) -
https://github.com/nodejs/tracing-wg/issues/34

Patrick:

* nothing to do with new tracing facility
* has to do with existing LTTNG support
* some discussion here about what tracing events / probes should be used


wrap-up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[18:18](https://youtu.be/vxY_OLHF66A?t=1098)

Patrick:

* structure working?  like having issues to go through, with tasks lists?  no
  nays

* next meeting? In January?  No nays.

* create issue/doodle/gdoc for next meeting in a new issue
