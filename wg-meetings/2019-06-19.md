## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Async Hooks do not recognize execution contexts created when processing thenables [#22360](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/22360)
    * M: I don’t see any discussion from meeting attendees
    * M: it sounded something like may need changes from the JS engine
    * N: in some cases we are losing context, but I don’t see conclusion
    * N: there is an issue around Bluebird context support
    * M: maybe it’s already fixed
    * N: they switched from domains
    * N: it may need to be propagated by V8
    * M: next step is not clear on this, someone should take a lead on it

### nodejs/diagnostics

* seeking feedback: diagnostic report tooling [#301](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/301)
    * M: let’s move on as we are missing lead from this meeting
    * Chris is giving a demo of “gnostic”
    * Gnostic can diff multiple Diagnostic Reports
    * Gnostic can be also used as a library
    * Support rules to check on long-running eventloop and other characteristics
    * There is an API for rule developers
    * Can sanitize reports
    * Transformations (use cases like plot a graph or pipe to unix tool)
    * Chris: what are the use cases for Diagnostic Reports?
    * Peter: we are planning to build a crash analysis system which needs sanitization and hashing
    for reports (stack traces)
    * M: I see a value in a solution that can community reuse and it could live in Gnostic
    * C: project is not public yet but hopefully it will be soon, I can share the slides
    * M: will it be MIT? Apache?
    * C: Apache?
    * N: Process running out of memory use-case, people trying to use Node Report
    * N: they don’t have time to learn about it. I believe it would be useful if Gnostic comes with
    recommended/default recipes to lower the entry barrier
    * M: For example trouble with getting core dumps, check for ulimit in reports
    * C: maybe asking what;s wrong instead of what do you want to do?
    * N: I’d like id sanitizing code would be available separately for reusing it

* proposal: --inspect-store flag [#298](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/298)
    * M: Any context Peter, I think it’s related to Netflix’s efforts?
    * P: I’m not sure, but I can ping Mattheus
    * N: it’s one the agenda to consider using diagnostics report to ???
    * M: we need Aleksei to make progress

* Proposal to drive Diagnostics WG initiatives through user journeys [#295](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/295)
    * P: two action items
    * P: one to send out survey (Peter to create issue and include link)
    * P: two to: schedule first deep dive on first use case (Peter to open issue and propose date)
    * P: let’s start with deep drive that we already started to work on it
    * G: I can help to review survey, also would like to see questions around use-case / user    journey gaps
    * Peter will open a Google docs for collaboration and turn it to a form later

* Perfetto in Node.js [#277](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/277)
    * Skip as we don’t have the right people for an update.

* Diagnostics "Best Practices" Guide? [#211](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/211)
    * Gireesh -> discovered under user journeys.
    * Gireesh: #285 is the starting point for the best practices document, Given that crash and
    memory are already agreed to be important no harm working on these in parallel.
    * Peter: should we add to survey, is there anything to ask?
    * M: for example, what’s the level of knowledge people already have?
    * N: based on my survey experience in user experience research the recommendation was to
    start with a situation how do they deal instead of asking for solutions, like asking how to deal
    with specific use-cases like crashing process? Should we mention paid tools to ask on OSS
    tools? Would it be overstepping to mention paid tools?
    * P: I’ll add a TODO section about best practices questions to the survey docs and people can
    add if they have something to ask

* Diag WG Deep Dives - topics [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
    * no update.

* \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    * no update

* Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
    * no update
